# MARS Control Unit

Repository for MARS control unit communication that is used to control robots at
CIIRC/CTU.

The code is heavily based on the https://github.com/cvut/pyrocon software, especcially
the https://github.com/cvut/pyrocon/blob/master/CRS_commander.py file that specifies
communication with MARS8 control unit.
